# R2-ERGM
Avaliable code to calculate coefficients of determination (R2) for exponential random graph models.



This repository includes all of the code to replicate the results of the manuscript titled, "COEFFICIENTS OF DETERMINATION (R2) FOR EXPONENTIAL RANDOM GRAPH MODELS". All the scripts are numbered and must be run in numeric order. I've included notes throughout the scripts to help users run them and understand the computation procedures. You have install all the necessary packages that I call on throughout the different scripts:

install.packages('utils')
install.packages('dplyr')
install.packages('igraph')
install.packages('intergraph')
install.packages('statnet')
install.packages('Bergm')
